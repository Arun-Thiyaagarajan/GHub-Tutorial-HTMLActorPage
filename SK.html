        <h3>Career</h3>
        <p>
            During college, Sivakarthikeyan took part in various cultural events and performed mimicry and standup comedy onstage.[6] Between his studies, he took a three month-break, and during this period, his friends convinced him to go for auditions of Kalakka Povathu Yaaru?, a comedy reality TV show airing on Star Vijay. He started his career as a mimicry artist. Despite initial reluctance to participate, he won the show.[7] He appeared in short films, including his friend Atlee's Mugapputhagam,[8] Identity, Kurahl 786, and 360Â°. The makers of Aegan noticed Sivakarthikeyan and offered him a supporting role in the film, but his portions did not make the final cut.
